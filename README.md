# @audrey's profile on Rotonde for Beaker Browser

This repo is basically a profile on the Rotonde social network, and this one is mine :) It's built for the Beaker browser which allows p2p networking, no central servers needed! Follow the setup instructions below to start your own!

<br>

**`@audrey` on Rontode, find me in the Beaker Browser  at:**
```
dat://49a043352e6bd3d00e8398b56c79b0dc3c3ec92f678259cb505ece6673e486cd/
```
<br>

<div style="clear: both;"/>
If you're on Rotonde, paste a user's address (like mine above) into your `Input` field to 'follow' them.
<br><br>
Since `dat://` is peer-to-peer, in Beaker, you can click the **menu ( ` â–¼ ` )** in rightmost side of the URL bar, to get an option to **"Add to Library"**. If you add a site to your library like this, you become a seed! The more seeds, the more likely the site will be available to others.

**Instructions from the original repo:**
